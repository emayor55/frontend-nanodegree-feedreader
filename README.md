### Testing javascript using the Jasmine test framework 

*How to start the application*

1. Locate the file named 'index.html' 

2. Open the 'index.html' file using a browser by double-clicking on the file icon. 

3. If the default program that opens 'html' files on your computer is  not a browser, you can open 'index.html' by right-clicking on the icon, locating the 'Open with...' option on the pop-up menu, and selecting a browser from the options provided. 

### Additional Tests Added
*The following three tests were added to the set originally required:

1. A test to confirm that when a menu item is clicked, the menu will be hidden.

2. A test to confirm that number of items in the menu matches number of feeds in the allFeeds object. 

3. A test to confirm that when a new feed is selected the heading for the page also changes. 

Nos.1 and 2 were added to _'The menu'_ test suite. 

No. 3 was added to the _'New Feed Selection'_ suite.
